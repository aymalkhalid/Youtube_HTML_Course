# Youtube HTML Course

This repository contains all the code, examples, and resources for the Youtube HTML Course by Aymal Khalid. It is designed for beginners who want to learn HTML and web development step by step.

## Contents

- **HTML Lessons:**
  - Each lesson is provided as a separate HTML file, covering topics from basic structure to advanced forms, tables, accessibility, and embedding media.
  - Example: `video_06_html_basic_structure.html`, `video_14_html_forms.html`, `video_24_embedding_media.html`, etc.

- **Practical Examples:**
  - The `examples/` folder contains sample projects like a portfolio website and related CSS files.

- **Python Flask Demos:**
  - Simple Flask apps (`flask_forms_post.py`, `flask_static_forms_post.py`) to demonstrate HTML forms with backend handling.

- **Assets:**
  - Images, audio, and video files (e.g., `brown_cat.jpg`, `azan1.mp3`) used in lessons.

## How to Use

1. **Browse Lessons:**
   - Open any HTML file in your browser or code editor to see the code and comments.
2. **Try Examples:**
   - Explore the `examples/portfolio.html` and `examples/style.css` for a real-world project structure.
3. **Experiment:**
   - Modify the files, add your own content, and practice what you learn.
4. **Run Flask Demos:**
   - If you have Python installed, try running the Flask scripts to see how HTML forms work with a backend.

## Naming Best Practices

- Use clear, descriptive names for files, classes, and IDs (e.g., `main-header`, `contact-form`).
- Follow consistent naming conventions (kebab-case for classes/IDs, lowercase for filenames).
- Good names make your code easier to read, maintain, and share.

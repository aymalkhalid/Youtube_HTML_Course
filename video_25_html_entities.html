    <h1>HTML Entities Made Easy!</h1>
    <!--
    =====================================
    | What are HTML Entities?            |
    =====================================
    Sometimes, you want to show special characters in your web page, like
     <, >, or &.
    But these characters have special meaning in HTML, so you can't just type them directly.
    HTML entities are a way to show these characters safely!
    They always start with (Ampersand) the sign `&` and end with a semicolon (;).

    <h2>Simple Examples</h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h2>Useful Symbols</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>nbsp; - Non-breaking space (like a space that won't break into a new line)</li>
        <li>copy; - Copyright symbol (©)</li>
        <li>euro; - Euro symbol (€)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why Use Them?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To show special characters like &lt;, &gt;, &amp; in your page.</li>
        <li>To add cool symbols (like &copy;, &euro;, &trade;).</li>
        <li>To make sure your HTML works everywhere!</li>
    </ul>

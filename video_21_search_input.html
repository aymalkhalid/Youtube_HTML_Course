    =====================================
    Building a Google-like search page using HTML search input.
    
    The search input type is perfect for creating search interfaces because:
    - Browsers may add a clear (X) button automatically
    - On mobile devices, it may show an optimized keyboard
    - It's semantically correct for search functionality
    
    Real-life examples:
    - Google's main search box
    - Website search bars
    - E-commerce product search
    - Social media search features
    
    Attributes used:
    - type="search": Specifies this input is for search queries
    - id: Links the input to its label for accessibility
    - name: The key sent to the server (commonly "q" for "query")
    - placeholder: Shows hint text inside the input
    - autocomplete: Helps browsers suggest previous searches
    
    Step by Step to create a search box:
    We have a div with class "search-container" that contains:
        1. Create a form element with action pointing to the search engine (e.g., https://www.google.com/search)
        2. Add an input element with type="search"
        3. Set the name attribute to "q" (or similar) for search queries
        4. Add a placeholder to guide users on what to search for?
    - autocomplete: Helps browsers suggest previous searches
    - target="_blank": Opens the search results in a new tab

    1. Create a form element with action pointing to the search engine (e.g., https://www.google.com/search)
    2. Add an input element with type="search"
    3. Set the name attribute to "q" (or similar) for search queries
    4. Add a placeholder to guide users on what to search for?
    5. Add a submit button to trigger the search
    6. Optionally, add a button for "I'm Feeling Lucky" functionality

    <div class="search-container">
        <form action="https://www.google.com/search" method="GET" target="_blank">
            <input type="search" id="search-query" name="query" placeholder="Search the web..." autocomplete="on">
            <input type="submit" value="Search">

        </form>

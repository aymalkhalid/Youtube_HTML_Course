    <!-- Lecture 5: Container Elements (Div and Span) -->

    <!-- 1. DIV AND SPAN CONTAINERS -->
    <!--
        What are container elements?
        - Container elements help us group and organize content on a web page.
        - They don't add any special meaning to the content, but they make it easier to style and arrange things with CSS.
        
        <div> is for big sections.

        <span> is for small pieces of text.
    -->
    
    <!--
        =============================
        |   Beginner's Explanation   |
        =============================
        In HTML, we use special tags to organize and style our web pages. Two very common tags are <div> and <span>.
        
        - <div> is like a big box that can hold other elements. 
            It always starts on a new line and stretches across the page. We use it to group big sections of content.


        - <span> is like a small label. It only takes up as much space as it needs and stays in line with the text. 
            We use it to style or highlight small parts of text.
        
        Think of <div> as a big container, and <span> as a small sticker you put on words.
    -->
    
        <div> This is a Div Group Content</div>
        <div>Another div - it takes the full width and starts on a new line</div>
        <p>This paragraph has a <span>highlighted word</span> using span.</p>


    <!-- 2. COMBINING DIV AND SPAN -->
    
        <!-- You can use div and span together for better organization:
        
        <div> for larger sections
        <span> for small text styling within those sections
        
        Example: -->
        
        <div class="article_no_1">
            <h2>Article Title</h2>
            <p>This article talks about <span>important concepts</span> in web development.</p>
        </div>
   
    
    <div class="programming_languages">
        <h2>My Favorite Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>I love <span class="JS">JavaScript</span> for web development.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy <span class="Py">Python</span> for data analysis.</p>
        <p>And <span>HTML</span> is the foundation of the web!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="contact_info">
        <h2>Contact Information</h2>
        <p>Email me at: <span>contact@example.com</span></p>
        <p>Phone: <span class="Phone">+1-234-567-8900</span></p>
    </div>

    <!--
        =============================
        |        <div> Example      |
        =============================
        | This is a div            |
        |--------------------------|
        | Another div              |
        =============================

        <div> elements are BLOCK containers:
        - Each one starts on a new line
        - Takes up the full width available

        Example:
        <div>This is a div</div>
        <div>Another div</div>

        Output:
        [This is a div           ]
        [Another div             ]

        =============================
        |   <span> Example (inline) |
        =============================
        | This is a <span>word</span> in a sentence. |
        =============================

        <span> elements are INLINE containers:
        - Only take up as much space as needed
        - Stay on the same line as surrounding text

        Example:
        <p>This is a <span>highlighted</span> word.</p>

        Output:
        This is a [highlighted] word.

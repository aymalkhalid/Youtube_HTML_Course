    <!-- 1. WHAT ARE ID AND CLASS? -->
    <!--
        What are id and class in simple words?
        - id is a unique label for one element. Use it when you want to point to something special on the page.

        - class is a label you can give to many elements. Use it when you want to style or group similar things together.
        
        Example:
        <div id="header">This is the only header</div>
        <p class="highlight">This and other paragraphs can be highlighted</p>
    -->

        =============================
        |   Beginner's Explanation   |
        =============================
        In HTML, we sometimes want to give names or labels to our elements so we can style them or find them easily. We do this using the id and class attributes.
        
        - id: Like a unique name tag. Only one element on the page can have a certain id. Think of it as your student roll number—no one else has the same one.
        - class: Like a group name. Many elements can share the same class. Think of it as your class or team—many people can be in the same group.
        
        We use id for things that are special and only appear once, and class for things that are similar or need the same style.
    -->
    
    <!-- 2. ID EXAMPLES -->
    <!--
        Beginner Tip: What is an ID?
        An ID is like a special name tag for one thing on your page. You use it when you want to point to or style something unique,
         like the main header or a specific section. Only one element should have a certain ID!
    -->
    <!--
        Use ID for unique elements that appear only once:
        - Main navigation
        - Header section
        - Footer section
        - Specific sections you want to link to
        - Forms or buttons that need unique styling
        Diagram for the Main Elements:
        +-------------------+
        |     Main Header   |
        +-------------------+
        |   Navigation Bar  |
        +-------------------+
        |     About Section |
        +-------------------+
        |    Contact Section|
        +-------------------+
        +-------------------+
        |       Footer      |
        +-------------------+
        End of Website Structure
        This diagram shows the main elements of a simple website layout.
        Each section has a unique ID so we can link to it or style it differently.
        -->
    <div id="main-header">
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <p>This is the main header section.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="main-navigation">
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="about">
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>This section tells you about our website.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="contact">
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have questions, reach out to us!</p>
    </div>

    <div id="footer">
        <p>&copy; 2023 My Website</p>
    </div>


    <!-- 3. CLASS EXAMPLES -->
    <!--
        Beginner Tip: What is a class?
        A class is like a group label. You use it when you want to style or group many things that are similar, like all buttons or all product cards. Many elements can share the same class name!
    -->
    <!--
        Use CLASS for elements that share similar styling or behavior:
        - All buttons
        - All warning messages
        - All product cards
        - All highlighted text
    -->
    <div class="card-container">
        <h1> Product Card</h1>
        <p class="product-name">Car</p>
        <p class="product-price">$20,000</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card-container">
        <h1> Product Card</h1>
        <p class="product-name">Bike</p>
        <p class="product-price">$500</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 4. NAMING BEST PRACTICES -->
    <!--
        Beginner Tip: Naming Best Practices
        Good names make your code easier to read! Use clear, simple names for your ids and classes, like "main-header" or "highlight-text". 
        Avoid spaces and be consistent—just like naming your folders or files so you can find them easily later.
    -->
    <!--
        Good naming conventions:
        - Use descriptive names: id="main-navigation" not id="nav1"
        - Use kebab-case: class="user-profile" not class="userProfile"
        - Avoid spaces: class="highlight-text" not class="highlight text"
        - Be consistent throughout your project
        
        Examples of good names:
        - class="button-primary"
        - id="contact-form"
        - class="error-message"
        - id="main-content"
    -->
        
<!--     

    <div id="user-profile" class="card-container">
        <h2>User Profile</h2>
        <p class="user-name">John Doe</p>
        <p class="user-email">john@example.com</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="card-container">
        <h2>Settings</h2>
        <button class="button-primary">Save Changes</button>
        <button class="button-secondary">Cancel</button>
    </div> -->

    <!-- 5. MULTIPLE CLASSES -->
    <!--
        Beginner Tip: Multiple Classes
        You can give one element more than one class by separating the names with spaces. T
        his is like saying someone is in the "sports" group and the "music" group at the same time. 
        The element will get the styles from all its classes!
    -->
    <!--
        You can add multiple classes to one element by separating them with spaces:
        
        <div class="card highlight large">Content</div>
        
        This element has THREE classes: card, highlight, and large
        Useful for combining different styles or behaviors
    -->
    <!-- Real Life Example of Sports and Music Class -->
     <div class="sports music">
        <h2>John's Profile</h2>
        <p class="name">John Doe</p>
        <p class="age">Age: 25</p>
        <p class="hobby">Hobbies: Playing Football and Guitar</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sports">
        <h2>Jane's Profile</h2>
        <p class="name">Jane Smith</p>
        <p class="age">Age: 22</p>  
        <p class="hobby">Hobbies: Playing Basketball</p>
    </div>

    <div class="music">
        <h2>Mike's Profile</h2>
        <p class="name">Mike Johnson</p>
        <p class="age">Age: 30</p>
        <p class="hobby">Hobbies: Playing Guitar</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 4. Text Formatting Elements:
        How do we format text within paragraphs?
        Answer: We use formatting tags inside other elements
        
        Bold Text:
        - <strong> - Semantic (tells screen readers this is important)
        - <b> - Visual only (just makes text bold visually)
        
        Italic Text:
        - <em> - Semantic (tells screen readers this is emphasized)
        - <i> - Visual only (just makes text italic visually)
        
        Other formatting:
        - <u> - Underlined text
        - <del> or <s> - Strikethrough text
        - <sup> - Superscript (raised text)
        - <sub> - Subscript (lowered text)
    -->
    <h2>Text Formatting Examples</h2>
    
    <p>This paragraph shows important <strong>bold text</strong> using the strong tag.</p>
    <p>This paragraph shows <b>visual bold text</b> using the b tag.</p>
    
    <p>This paragraph shows <em>emphasized italic text</em> using the em tag.</p>
    <p>This paragraph shows <i>visual italic text</i> using the i tag.</p>
    
    <p>This paragraph shows <u>underlined text</u> using the u tag.</p>
    
    <p>This paragraph shows <del>deleted/strikethrough text</del> using the del tag.</p>
    <p>This paragraph shows <s>strikethrough text</s> using the s tag.</p>
    
    <p>Mathematical formula: E = mc<sup>2</sup> (superscript for squared)</p>
    <p>Chemical formula: H<sub>2</sub>O (subscript for water)</p>
    
    <p>You can also <strong>combine <em>multiple formatting</em> tags</strong> together!</p>

    <!-- 5. Line Breaks and Spacing:
        How do we create line breaks and horizontal lines?
        Answer: <br> for line breaks, <hr> for horizontal rules
        
        Important Note: 
        - <br> should NOT be used for spacing between paragraphs
        - Use CSS for spacing instead (we'll learn this later)
        - <br> is for line breaks within the same paragraph or poem
        - Both <br> and <hr> are self-closing tags (no closing tag needed)
    -->
    <h2>Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules</h2>
    
    <p>This is a paragraph with a line break.<br>
    This text appears on the next line, but it's still the same paragraph.</p>
    
    <p>Here's a poem example:<br>
    Roses are red,<br>
    Violets are blue,<br>
    HTML is awesome,<br>
    And so are you!</p>
    
    <hr> <!-- This creates a horizontal line -->
    
    <p>The horizontal rule above separates content sections.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Don't use multiple <br> tags for spacing!<br><br><br>
    Like this example above - it's bad practice!</p>
    
    <p>Instead, use separate paragraphs for different thoughts, and CSS for spacing (coming in future lectures).
        
    </p>

    <!-- 6. HTML VOCABULARY - Essential Terms:
        Understanding the difference between ELEMENTS and TAGS is crucial!
        
        ELEMENT vs TAG - This is important!:
        - ELEMENT = The complete structure (opening tag + content + closing tag)
        - TAG = Just the markup symbols with angle brackets < >
        
        Example:
        <p>Hello World</p>  ← This entire thing is an ELEMENT
        <p> ← This is the opening TAG
        </p> ← This is the closing TAG
        "Hello World" ← This is the CONTENT
        
        Other Important Vocabulary:
        - ATTRIBUTE = Extra information added to tags
        - VALUE = What the attribute is set to
        - MARKUP = The code/tags that structure content
        - SEMANTIC = Tags that have meaning (like <strong> for importance)
        - VISUAL = Tags that only change appearance (like <b> for bold)

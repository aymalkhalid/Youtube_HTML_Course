<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- The purpose of this file is to provide a basic structure for a web page. -->
 <!-- The main purpose of Doctype html is to inform the web browser about the type of document it is going to render. 
        It helps the browser to display the content correctly. 
        The doctype declaration is not an HTML tag, but it is an instruction to the web browser.
        It should be the first line in an HTML document. 
        if it is not present, the browser may render the page in "quirks mode", 
        which can lead to inconsistent rendering across different browsers. 
        The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive, but it is recommended to use 
        lowercase for consistency. -->

        2. It improves accessibility for users with screen readers or other assistive technologies.

    <h1>Advanced HTML Form Input: File Upload</h1>

        =====================================
        | FILE UPLOAD INPUT                 |
        =====================================
        The file input type allows users to select one or more files from their device to upload.
        This is commonly used for profile pictures, document uploads, etc.

        Attributes:
        - type="file": Specifies the input is for file selection.
        - id: Unique identifier for the input, used to link with a <label>.
        - name: The key sent to the server with the file data.
        - accept: Restricts the types of files users can select (e.g., images only: accept="image/*").
        - multiple: Allows users to select more than one file.
        - required: Makes file selection mandatory before form submission.

        Accessibility:
        - Always use a <label> for the file input so users know what to upload.
        -->
        <label for="file-upload-resume">Upload your Resume file:</label>
        <input type="file" id="file-upload-resume" name="file-upload-resume" accept=".pdf,.doc,.docx" multiple required>
        <br><br>
        <!--
            Example for multiple images:
            The accept="image/*" attribute restricts the selectable files to images only, such as JPEG, PNG, or GIF formats.
             This helps guide users to choose appropriate files and can prevent accidental selection of non-image files. 
             The multiple attribute allows users to select more than one file at a time,
              enabling batch uploads of images rather than requiring them to select and upload each image individually.
            <input type="file" id="photos" name="photos" accept="image/*" multiple>

        -->
    <label for="file-upload-images">Upload your Images:</label>
    <input type="file" id="file-upload-images" name="file-upload-images" accept="image/*" multiple>
    <br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Upload">
    <input type="reset" value="Reset">
    </form>
